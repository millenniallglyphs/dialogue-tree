# Hello World

why open source design. It's all out in the open. Design does not generally intersect with security. However similar principals of many eyes still hold true. When designing something new, most products fail due to usability details. This was true with early speech synthesization. The problem was that it was not a bad technology, it was implemented in an a poor context. This principal holds true, especially when it comes to general purpose technologies. This is where open source design comes into play. With many eyes and perspective you can have a process that does a much better job assessing the aspects of a product and its design.

One of the most difficult things for a designer to have real insight into is the context of use. While a design research can ask questions and learn about individual usage, they are bound by their own limitation, either of time perception, bias, etc. However with a community of contributors, much of this can be overcome. People can supply this information and make suggestions from their vantage.

Importantly, not everyone is coming in with a background that makes them think like designers. This helps provide greater insight into functionality.

The one big barrier is technical skill level. Contributors to open source projects often have a high level of technical knowledge that may not match the average user.

Combining community input with selective research can help bridge this gap.

how do you represent natural language in structured natural language.

based upon these discussion I'm seeing this as a possible twin technology to blockchain
