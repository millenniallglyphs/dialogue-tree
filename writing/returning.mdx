For the past two years I've been living on the Olympic Peninsula, in the northwestern corner of Washington State. First in a tiny house built on the broad loamy plain of the Dungeness river, and then in a cabin on a farm, tucked into the foothills of the Olympic mountains. I took a leap of faith. I left my job in New York to pursue carpentry, gardening and deepen my practices of anti-fragility. And after two years, I am once again making a leap, leaving my cabin to reconcile the career I left, and the lessons I learned attempting to forge a simple life bound to the essence of the land. 

I have 3 convictions that will guide this next chapter:

1. **Web3 is composed of heterogeneous organization that will redefine the SaaS market.** 
4. **Resilience is Growing All Around. Let's Make tools worthy of this future.**
5. **I need to be a part of the "global social computer in the cloud" to contribute to this vision.**

### Web3 is composed of heterogeneous organization that will redefine the SaaS market.

I propose web3 marks a transition from an internet that routes data, to an internet that also routes obligation. This is not only a characteristic of smart contracts. It is also a fundamental quality of tokens. Tokens represent a social relationship. They form a social container within which this value is exchangeable, and a context within which people holding the tokens can seek recourse. This defines a sense of shared obligation, that can be directed in specific ways. At its heart, this quality of obligation represents a paradigm of is => ought. That is a process of transformation, both in individual smart contracts, and in collections of smart contracts that build the framework of decentralized collaborative organizations. 

All of this is can be summed in the following way. DLT enables novel forms of interrelating and management that are an effective structure for collaborative work. This is clearly demonstrated by the number of protocols under DAO management. However, I think few grasp this significance. I see DAOs and other decentralized collaborative organizations as major consumers of SaaS in the future. In fact you could argue that snapshot and colony already operate as SaaS (or perhaps Governance as a Service GaaS).

SaaS is one of the largest industries in the world. However, SaaS products are built with many assumptions about the nature and structure clients that are often not true for DAOs. DAOs represent a heterogeneous collection of organization that range from platform cooperatives, to asset management, to everything in-between. As these organizations grow, mature and adapt to novel niches, they will require novel tools and software to support their efforts. Aragon has a flexible framework that is enabling the creation of an ecosystem of apps for DAOs. However, I see a crucial gap that has to do with communication, knowledge management, and horizontal strategies for performance. It is in this space of decentralized, collaborative working tools that I want to be contributing work. 

### Resilience is Growing All Around. Let's Make tools worthy of this future

In my time here, I've gotten a dog, Cobol. I took a timber frame construction course and built a house using traditional woodworking techniques along side ten other people. I've tended gardens, learning by helping across the seasons. I learned food preservation techniques, during the fall harvest. I deepened connection, building bonds of kinship with friends, family and place. At the same time, I began a quite practice of study, pursuing lines of inquiry and contributing to open source projects.  

 met Justin at the farmers market. He invited me to visit his farm and when I arrived, Justin had me hop in his golf cart for a breakneck tour of the property. For the past decade Justin has been rehabilitating what was first a cattle farm and then an ostridge farm. There no longer livestock of any kind on the farm. Instead, as Justin summarized on the tour, he's rebuilding the depth of the soil and quality rhizomatic  systems within through permaculture techniques. Not only is this process improving the capacity of the land, at the sametime, Justin is producing food throughout the season. 

In particular, Justin is focused on resilience. For this reason, he cultivates an enormous variety of fruit, nut, and sap trees on his property. Wizzing down the hill on the golf cart, Justin points out varieties of pine nuts. We pass an orchard of persimmons, where Justin Invites me to taste the fruit. Then there are the monkey trees, the grapes, the autumn berries, the sap bearing eucalyptus, and so many more. 

Later that evening, Justin and I are sitting in front of his masonry stove. Justin tells me about the challenge of sourceing seeds from around the world. We discuss the legal and financial obstacles, as well as the lack of a framework to share the knowledge gained from experience cultivating many of the lesser known varietals. From there the conversations shifts to local food systems and the logisitcal challenges of food banks. 

The conversations then shifts to web3. I share the work I had been contributing to ERA, and we talk about some of the possibilities of defi. From this a vision emerges, putting the pieces together. 


### I need to be part of the online brain to do any of this

m both nervous and excited. I'm nervous because there's a lot I've missed. Logging back on, the contents of my feed have changed significantly. I see a coalescence of thought surrounding web3. A year ago there was significant interest, but many of these ideas seem to have crystallized in a way that now gives them greater transmissibility and directionality. 

At the same time this is excited. I'm excited to see old friends, start new conversations, learn from new people, and perhaps most importantly engage in a spirit of collaboration and growth. 

Need to hop back in, because I sense a way of being with web3, and I want to work towards it

This is me humbly dipping my toes back into the water

Feeling out of touch, but am excited to talk, collaborate and build with people

> We are all now part of a powerful global social computer in the cloud that is possibly the only mechanism we have available to tackle the big problems of the world that industrial age mechanisms are failing to cope with. We might as well get good at it. Do your part. Stay as plugged in as you can.
