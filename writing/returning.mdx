### Exposition

For the past two years I've been living on the Olympic Peninsula, in the northwestern corner of Washington State. First in a tiny house built on the broad loamy plain of the Dungeness river, and then in a cabin on a farm, tucked into the foothills of the Olympic mountains. I took a leap of faith. I left my job in New York to pursue carpentry, gardening and deepen my practices of anti-fragility. And after two years, I am once again making a leap, leaving my cabin to reconcile the career I left, and the lessons I learned attempting to forge a simple life bound to the essence of the land. 

### Problem

What precipitated this shift? In short, I have found myself building projects that cannot be sustained in isolation. The scope of this work requires public interface and collaboration and critique. I see clearly that this work is going to require a process of learning that is public. 

VGR writes that part of the emergent process is engaging with the "global social computer in the cloud." While my time walden-ponding has given me space to formulate this endeavor, the reflective environment has now become stifling.

### Rising Action

What is the project compelling this shift. It is a project that has been growing, and morphing for some time now. It has taken many different forms. It is manifest in some ways in the piece I just wrote about web3 and the future of SaaS, but this is only a piece of a larger inquiry about decentralized collaboration. 

However to elements are primarily responsible for the coalescence of thought. A year ago I began pulling research together that would eventually form [[neighborhood scale software]]. This was spawned from research about the historical roots of the firm, Ostromian negotiation, and was deeply influence by Christopher Alexander's "pattern language."

> Web3 enables novel funding mechanisms, and methods of interrelating that enable software to be developed in contexts and at scales not previously viable. Platform cooperatives and decentralized collaborative organizations have the opportunity to create bespoke software solutions for their specific community contexts. Designing neighborhood scale software ask: how do people collaborate in this context? What tools, and design patterns are most useful? What kinds of outcomes can be expected?

The second event was taking the "Platform Cooperatives" course presented by the New School. This course, organized by Trebor Scholze asked people to consider how to enact these structures. I began collaborating with what's his name. The primary question being: why are platform cooperatives not a ubiquitous DAO use-case, and what tools and strategies could help enable this. 

### Crisis

This project ballooned, pulling my research in many directions. From appropriate technology, to the nature of the firm, to statistical analysis of DAO implementation, it became clear that the scope had far exceeded the constraints of the course. I was never able to complete a final essay for the course because my research had grown in scope and could not be wrangled back into 3000 word essay. 

In the intervening months I have had a chance to continue my research, reflect on the process, and write. The result is a collection of nearly formed essays. These are the following tentative titles:

- Web3 and the SaaS Opportunity
- Collectors, Coops, and Protocol Stewardship: An Analysis of DAO Deployment 
- The Is/Ought Internet: Obligation, Tokens, Rules, and Scale
- Trust in the Trustless Environment: Performance, Sensemaking, and Interrelating
- Horizontal Management Methodologies, Patterns of Collaboration

I plan to start releasing these essays shortly. I suspect more writing will grow from this initial collection.  

### Climax

However, this exploration does not end with writing. As I mentioned before, Christorpher Alexander's "Pattern language" was a major inspiration. I would like to continue the trajectory building out a collaborative project that builds a pattern language for DAOs. This would be a UX/UI focused collective that seeks to improve the soft side of DAO performance. The idea would be to build an open source knowledge base to help supplement the efforts of existing projects, such as Aragon. 

Additionally, I feel compelled to make this exploration my full time effort.  I would like would like to find a job that allows me to engage with one or more of the following areas:

- remote work
- team performance
- collaborative tools
- knowledge bubbles/group knowledge management
- the codification of informal conversations into formal documentation
- horizontal management practices
- crisis of cosmology
- HROs

### Falling Action

To accomplish this, I am jumping back onto social media, and jumping back into the job market. While I had been quietly been doing product design work to support my time in the cabin, this marks a substantial shift.

I am leaving walden. And though I may still be living in my cabin for the next little bit, I am making a cosmological departure. I will hold onto the lessons I learned spending time outside in an animate world. I will continue to learn from carpentry and the physical arts. In short, I'm keeping my feet on the ground, but my head in the "global social computer in the cloud."

### Conclusion

I'm eager to build connection around the ideas outlined in this essay. Interested in chatting, collaborating, or pointing me towards work that would fit this niche? Please hit me up!

I look forward to the next chapter.
