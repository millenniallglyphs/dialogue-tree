 DAOs are enabling the emergence of heterogeneous collaboration, happening at novel scales, and with novel outputs. Web3 is experiencing a shortage of specific and effective tools for communication and collaboration. At the same time the corporate world is experiencing a design renaissance as new tools enable deeper integration of design and business processes, while at the same time opening space for novel niches such as design operations to emerge as distinct fields. I believe the opportunity here is so significant I'm giving up the life I've built over the past two years to pursue it. 

For the past two years I've been living on the Olympic Peninsula, in the northwestern corner of Washington State. First, in a tiny house built on the broad fertile plain of the Dungeness river, and second, in a cabin on a farm, tucked into the foothills of the Olympic mountains. Coming out here, I took a leap of faith. I left my job in New York to pursue anti-fragility through gardening and carpentry. After two years, I am once again making a leap in an attempt to reconcile my career with the lessons I learned attempting to forge a simple life. 

The cause of this transformation is rooted in the difficulty of forward progression. I have run into the hard limits of growth, while living in a self imposed state of hermitage. The solution is not necessarily to physically abandon my cabin. Rather it is to reengaging with what Venkatesh Rao [calls](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/against-waldenponding?utm_source=url) the "global social computer in the cloud." Over the past two years, I slowly stepped away from all forms of social media. This was not a premeditated actâ€”it happened mostly out of frustration. This was exactly what I needed.  My time "Walden-ponding" has given me space to reflect and formulate. But now that I have a project, this silence is impossible to maintain.

#### A Process of Discovery

Over the next months I'll be releasing a series of essays. That build off one another. This body of work has emerged slowly over the past year and a half.  

In December of 2020, I began pulling research together that would eventually form [[neighborhood scale software]](). I framed the problems pace of this course as follows: 

> Web3 enables novel funding mechanisms, and methods of interrelating that enable software to be developed in contexts and at scales not previously viable. Platform cooperatives and decentralized collaborative organizations have the opportunity to create bespoke software solutions for their specific community contexts. Designing neighborhood scale software asks: how do people collaborate in this context? What tools and design patterns are most useful? What kinds of outcomes can be expected?

Last October, I participated in a course hosted by New School called [Platform Cooperatives](). Through this course I met [Lucas Mcgranahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasmcgranahan/). We began thinking about how to practically deploy a platform Coop. Over time the question evolved: why are platform cooperatives not a ubiquitous DAO use-case, and what tools and strategies could help enable this. This project ballooned, pulling my research in many directions. From appropriate technology, to the nature of the firm, to statistical analysis of DAO implementation, it became clear that the scope had far exceeded the constraints of the course. 

Seperately, [Craig Atkinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigaatkinson/) and I began collaborating to develop a methodology for communications, project management, and on-boarding for the [Xalgortihms Foundation](https://xalgorithms.org). Xalgorithms Foundation produces Free/Libre/Open software as a distributed collaborative organization. This involves the coordination and alignment of decentralized team members across skills sets. The result has been the creation of novel management frameworks and the development of custom project management workflows to facilitate the Foundation's efforts. 

These three projects represent the nexus of powerful threads. DAOs are enabling the emergence of heterogeneous collaboration, happening at novel scales, and with novel outputs. Web3 is experiencing a shortage of specific and effective tools for communication and collaboration. The corporate world is experiencing a design renaissance as new tools enable deeper integration of design and business processes, while at the same time opening space for novel niches such as design operations to emerge as a distinct fields. From this confluence, I've authored a collection of essays that attempt to identify and opperationalize the opportunity I see here:

- **Web3 and the SaaS Opportunity**
- **Collectors, Coops, and Protocol Stewardship: An Analysis of DAO Deployment Purposes**
- **The Is/Ought Internet: Obligation, Tokens, Rules, and Scale**
- **Trust in the Trustless: Performance, Sense-Making, and Interrelating**
- **Horizontal Management Strategies: Patterns of Collaboration**

I'm excited to begin sharing this work, getting feedback, collaborating, and building. My hope is that this work will complement the work already being done by the free/libre/open communities of [Argon](https://aragon.io), [Common Stack](https://commonstack.org) and others.

#### Jumping Back In

To conclude, I'm taking metaphysical leave from Walden, and am jumping back into the thick of things. I'm looking forward to connecting with Twitter friends I've neglected. I'm eager to connect with people I don't yet know with ideas and enthusiasm. I'm anticipating contributing, collaborating, and developing projects that emerge from writing and conversation.

Stepping away from New York, and the frenetic online spaces I inhabited gave me the space and time to reflect needed for my thinking to mature. Now that my ideas have crystallized, I'm more eager than ever to return online with a purpose. I will continue with the practices of anti-fragility I have developed so that I may keep my feet on the ground while my head is in the "global social computer in the cloud."
