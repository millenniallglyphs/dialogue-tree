### Exposition

It's been two years since I left New York. The summer of 2020 anxiety about climate, feelings of precarity, the misery of the first year of lockdown, and the creeping feeling that the creative technologist role I had was not producing anything meaningful crystalized into a decision to leave. 

For the past two years I've been living on the Olympic Peninsula, in the north western corner of Washington State. First in a tiny house located along the broad loamy flood plain of the Dungeness river. Now I am in a cabin I renovated on friend's farm, tucked into the foothills of the Olympic mountains. In my time here, I've gotten a dog, Cobol. I took a timber frame construction course and built a house using traditional woodworking techniques along side ten other people. I've tended gardens, learning by helping across the seasons. I learned food preservation techniques, during the fall harvest. I deepened connection, building bonds of kinship with friends, family and place. At the same time, I began a quite practice of study, pursuing lines of inquiry and contributing to open source projects.  

### Problem

This past Fall I read Walden Pond again. Perhaps no image in Walden is more significant that the train. The train cuts through the wild lands, it whistle pierces the cool New England air, its presence recasting the universe. 

At the same time as the North American continent comes under the coordinated control of time tables, rail out-posts and clocks, the dreams of private yeoman utopia are recast by the railroad. Railroads required a scale, complexity, and reliability of organization that had not previously existed.

For Thoreau and the farmers of New England, it didn't matter if they embraced the new technology, or distanced themselves. The development of this novel coordinated force within the market upset trade relationships and reconstituted relationships with land, communities, and the broader world. This technology was reshaping not only landscapes, but markets, organizational design, patterns of agriculture, social life, and self perception. 

We are in a similar moment  of transition now. Smoke in the summer from fires. Lockdowns from pandemic. But perhaps of equal significance are the structural changes shifting markets and the shape of things to come. 

These are the innovations of web2 and they have only begun to cement. The successes of the internet have been characterized by developing economies around the organization of information. 

- Amazon organizing economies around the data associated with products and logistics
- Google organizing economies around the data of network traffic and advertising


### Rising Action

Smoke in the summer from fires. Lockdowns from pandemic. But perhaps of equal significance are the structural changes shifting markets and the shape of things to come. 

Not NFTs, but a more fundamental change underway.

### Climax

Jumpoing back in. Coming out of stealth mode. 

To enable this next step is going need really good service design. Understanding of how people move from community to organization

Much more its going to require asking challenging questions about what tools are needed. What management strategies are performant. What does trust look like in a trustless environment. What does the future of work and remote collaboration look like?

### Falling Action

excited to collab and contribute

excited to share continued work with xalorithms
