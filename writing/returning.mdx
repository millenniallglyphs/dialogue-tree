Last night woke up feeling stressed. I was feeling anxious about my current state in life. I was fixated on the fact that I don't have a lot of money and am in a strange position with my career. 

However I also was feeling proud of myself for leaving nyc, for getting out of my grandma's for renovating a cabin, for being in the woods every day, for working towards a simpler life.

So It is worthwhile to outline the overarching themes I hope to embody. In other words, what am I actually fighting for, and how does it break down into action.

Clearly I am motivated by something deeper than just a job. I am fighting for resilience and staying power in a world of climate chaos. Yes, I want to a job, but I am also motivated by a strong connection to the earth and being able to invest in sustainable practices that can provide security for me and my family. 

This does involve concrete goals.

Part of it is making money to buy land and make investments. also having the money to be able to afford a family

Another part has to do with investing in sustainable practices. This means working on developing alternative economies. This also means taking on practices of farming, simple living, frugality, etc.

It means being engaged in community and having my ear turned towards the earth. 

Things to tout:

chain saw skills

taking the timber frame class

renovating a cabin

going for walks in the woods every day and learning to live in a world beyond me 

Got a dog

Reasons for jumping back in. Much of my community is online, and being engaged means having a public presence. 

vgr is correct that it is impossible to realistically stay offline. there is a need to connect. 

Walden is about a tension between the pastoral and the emerging industrial economy

returning with a clear picture of how to engage and an understanding of what I want.
