 DAOs are enabling the emergence of heterogeneous forms of organization. Yet, Web3 is lagging when it comes to effective tools that facilitate the kind of communication and collaboration needed to unlock this potential. At the same time, the corporate world is experiencing a renaissance of collaboration being led by design tools. There's an opportunity here—one which I believe is so significant I'm giving up the life I've built over the past two years to pursue it. 

For the past two years I've been living on the Olympic Peninsula, in the northwestern corner of Washington State. First, in a tiny house built on the broad plain of the Dungeness river, and second, in a cabin on a farm, tucked into the foothills of the Olympic mountains. Coming out here, I took a leap of faith. I left my job in New York to pursue anti-fragility through gardening and carpentry. I also slowly stepped away from all forms of social media during this time period. Now, after two years, I am once again making a leap, leaving my cabin and jumping back into what Venkatesh Rao [calls](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/against-waldenponding?utm_source=url) the "global social computer in the cloud." 

**Over the next months I'll be releasing a series of essays that build off one another.** This body of work has emerged slowly over the past year and a half.  

In December of 2020, I began pulling research together that would eventually form a course I created and taught called [Designing Neighborhood Scale Software](/projects/neighborhood-software). I framed the problems pace of this course as follows: 

> Web3 enables novel funding mechanisms, and methods of interrelating that enable software to be developed in contexts and at scales not previously viable. Platform cooperatives and decentralized collaborative organizations have the opportunity to create bespoke software solutions for their specific community contexts. Designing neighborhood scale software asks: how do people collaborate in this context? What tools and design patterns are most useful? What kinds of outcomes can be expected?

Last year, I participated in a course hosted by The New School called [Platform Coops Now!](https://blogs.newschool.edu/news/2020/06/platform-cooperatives-now-an-online-course-to-foster-platform-cooperatives-throughout-the-world/). Through this course I met [Lucas McGranahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasmcgranahan/). We began thinking about how to practically deploy a platform Coop. Over time the question evolved: why are platform cooperatives not a ubiquitous DAO use-case, and what tools and strategies could help enable this. This project ballooned, pulling my research in many directions. From appropriate technology, to the nature of the firm, to statistical analysis of DAO implementation, it became clear that the scope had far exceeded the constraints of the course. 

Seperately, [Craig Atkinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigaatkinson/) and I began collaborating to develop a methodology for communications, project management, and on-boarding for the [Xalgortihms Foundation](https://xalgorithms.org). Outputs of the Xalgorithms Foundation, as a distributed collaborative organization, include the production of functional Free/Libre/Open software reference implementations. This involves the coordination and alignment of decentralized team members across skills sets. The result has been the creation of novel management frameworks and the development of custom project management workflows to structure the efforts of the Foundation and its alliance of stakeholders.

These three projects represent the nexus of powerful threads. DAOs are enabling the emergence of heterogeneous organizations, forming at novel scales, and with novel outputs. Web3 is experiencing a shortage of specific and effective tools for communication and collaboration. The corporate world is experiencing a design renaissance as new tools enable deeper integration of design and business processes, while at the same time opening space for novel niches such as design operations to emerge as a distinct fields. From this confluence, I've authored a collection of essays that attempt to identify and opperationalize the opportunity I see here:

- **Web3 and the SaaS Opportunity**
- **Collectors, Coops, and Protocol Stewardship: An Analysis of DAO Deployment Purposes**
- **The Is/Ought Internet: Obligation, Tokens, Rules, and Scale**
- **Trust in the Trustless: Performance, Sense-Making, and Interrelating**
- **Horizontal Management Strategies: Patterns of Collaboration**

I'm excited to begin sharing this work, getting feedback, collaborating, and building. My hope is that this work will complement the work already being done by people across the free/libre/open DAO communities.

To conclude, I'm taking metaphysical leave from Walden, and am jumping back into the thick of things. I'm looking forward to connecting with old Twitter friends and am eager to connect with all the people I don't yet know in this space. Join my news letter for updates and future writing.
