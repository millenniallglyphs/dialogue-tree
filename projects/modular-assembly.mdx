### business problem trying to solve

With the technical specification complete for a quaternary bilattice rule authoring interface, my challenge was to figure out how to turn this into a usable interface.

Needed to begin authoring rules that can be uplaoded to rule reserve for system testing. 

Also required to begin developing rules for perceptual learning on-boarding modules (since a minimum of 200 rules are needed).

However the biggest thing that stops a novel technology is a design problem. See the example of machine speech

There is a paradox at play. There is not enough known about this emergent interface to really design with confidence. At the same time. A guess is need to start.

A prototype rule maker assembly pannel needs to be created. However, with research unfinished it needs to be flexible enough to accommodate user research related to both work flow and action validation. 

This panel should be able to placed within an application. It is also a site for experimentation. 

### describe the approach

Was presented with a spreadsheet of the required field and a technical paper. I had to figure out how to turn this into something usable. 

**High level strategy**

General purpose technology, but still requires a specific focus to begin building. This is the govt of Chile. Our first major stakeholderâ€”this provided a focus on legislature within the trade space.

Developed two tracts of research:

1. validation: testing the mechanics outlined in the technical specification.
2. workflow: examening actions both internal and external to the application  involved in rule authoring. This used to contextualize the rule authoring assembly panel. 

I  have been working with team members, specifically craig to conduct interviews relating to both research tracts. 

**Rule Schemas**

In order to have a flexible launch pad for this application, I realized we needed a flexible and modular system for exploring user actions.

Taking inspiration from Sanity Studio, I realize that being able to use json documents to generate custom sequences would be an efficient way to build a highly testable and customizable application. This has the added benefit of allowing domain specific variation in interface to be created by any dev implementing an instance of the application.

### results

You can download the prototype application here. 

### impact of the work

The impact is significant. The workshops have lead to greater involvement of major stakeholders. Have helped them take ownership, contributing dev time, etc.

Has also lead to significant research efforts into on-boarding, etc.
