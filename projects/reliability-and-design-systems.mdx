As Webb protocol expanded to include multiple products, it was clear developing a design system was critical both to ensure consistency, but also to build a reputation of trust and transparency. Co-leading the creation of the design system, our goal was to give users feedback on their actions and control of their assets at all times.

To accomplish this we deeply considered error states and edge cases, while also optimizing for power users. In addition, it was important to establish a clear visual language to differentiate assets, networks, relayers, and shielded assets, which, without unique shapes and profiles could easily be conflated.

The introduction of the design system streamlined both design and development workflows. Utilizing storybook, we were easily able to push and document elements of the design system for the dev team. Overall, the design system played a pivotal role in enhancing the user experience, promoting trust, and maintaining consistency within the Webb protocol ecosystem.
