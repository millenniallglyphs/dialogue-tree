### Exposition

In decentralized collaborative community, how does communication work. How is information shared, and how are decisions made?

###Problem

Working with Craig Atkinson, we mapped out a governance and communication, building upon the organizational structuring and definition of Joseph Potvin. The result is a multi layer communication effort with layer one being a space for the most substantive and fluid conversations, and layer three being the most static and most superficial.

Each layer has its own strategies and considerations. The challenge of layer 3 and in particular the web presence was of particular importance.

### Rising Action

At the core of this endavour was collaboration. It was clear that effective communication would come from the community, so workshops were organized to facilitate this process. 

To begin with it was critical to develop alignment on the baseline organizational narratives. This was achieved by brainstorming on a few basic questions. This exercise was framed around the idea of an elevator pitch which had a dual function. I allowed for the development of concise response, while at the same time allow us to practice sales tactics for an upcoming conference we attended to solicit funding.

### Climax

Next it became clear that information architechture was going to play a crucial role in informing the next steps. There was already a significant amount of content in existence for the site. The question was, how to organize it. Again, this required team input.

<iframe border="1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FHFd0zrNUYw9pMc4mCz9wBf%2FContent-Map%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From this we developed a high level organization structure, this made it possible for cascading categorization of content. This stage also brought out important insight of different contribution tracks based on skill sets. This insight led to the creation of specific messaging and calls to action depending on user skillset. 

This also helped to shift the philosophy behind the website. It made it clear that the website was a tool to help people find information. Even though it was primarily a communications role, its job was to direct people to the pieces of information they desired. Often this information existed outside the site itself, either in the project management application, or in gitlab. However this was helpful. It allowed for richer navigation to help create directed pathways to information and contribution options for people across skill sets. 

### Falling Action

The next step was to create an effective narrative for the landing page. This involved mapping out stories and concepting graphics. Again the process of developing this narrative was a community effort. The result of one story is mapped below. I ends in specific calls to action.

### End

The next steps are to focus on the other layers and to being consider the entire system at a zoomed out perspective.
