## Exposition

The Xalgorithms Foundation has created the Data With Direction Specification (DWDS) providing a general purpose free/libre/open design solution that enables any user, no matter the level of technical ability, to write rules that can be utilized across digital networks. After significant effort developing the systems architecture, entering the implementation phase of the project marks a major milestone. With this comes the challenge of validation, prototyping, and testing. This phase includes the involvement of stakeholders contributors, and authors. 

## Problem

Expressions in DWDS are elegant. However, multiple steps are needed to complete this task. First metadata must be entered. Second a rule is expressed in tabular form. None of these action are inherently complicated. However, in practice, each step involves significant cognitive load. 

In the case of metadata, users are presented with straightforwards prompts about the kind of data they must supply. However, determining accurate sources for this information can be challenging. For example, finding the original source of a rule is not always easy. Similarly, determining and accessing accurate product/service codes can present a challenge. 

Tabular rule expression presents a different set of  challenges. This task requires a user to engage with the source of rule, assessing the essential meaning of the rule. This requires significant consideration.

## Rising Action

The cognitive load involved in rule authoring is quite high. In additional to conceptual work involved, this specification introduces novel user mechanics. Rule expression utilizes a tabular method . Users are unfamilar with the mechanics of this opperation. Similarly rule expression involves structured syntactic expression. This means an open syntax but a predefined set of allowed grammatical structures.  Similar to madlibs, the user must become familiar with this method of expression to successfully author rules. 

## Crisis

This combination of characteristics is challenging  for any designer. However things are made more difficult by the fact that many of the product frameworks used to frame projects are not applicable in this situation. Importantly, this is a general purpose piece of software. It is not intended for a specific market or use-case. Rather, it is intended to be modified by developers to fit the needs of stakeholders that, by nature, are outside of this design process. While it is possible to imagine likely use-cases, and to learn from contributors who are motivated by domain specific deployments, it is important not to bias the functionality by becoming fixated on a single domain. 

These considerations require a divergent design strategy. Methods of assessing user needs, and developing empathetic framings are complicated. For example, personas and user journeys have utility, but must be held at arms length to remain impartial. A human centered approach must be complimented by clear understanding of developer deployment and stakeholder involvement across the implementation phase. 

## Solution

The multifaceted challenges require a combination of solutions. The following three strategies work in combination to define a strategic implementation of rule maker.

**Implement in Stages** 

Authoring a rule is a multi-step process. This presents challenges but also provides opportunity. By taking advantage of natural break points, it is possible to break on-boarding, user-testing, and stakeholder involvement into more manageable pieces. This has several advantages. It enables inquiry to be focused. It lets workshops target specific goals. Importantly this strategy producing data for system testing while producing tangible value for stakeholders. This strategy asserts that  mapping rule metadata alone produces significant value. This graduated approaches enables an effective on-ramp to full expression that involves stakeholders throughout the process.

**Focus Supported Actions**

Authoring a rule is a process that requires a deep interrogation of a source text and reflection on meaning, intention, and outcome. Much of this process is a purely cognitive activity. Only a portion of the actions involved are happening in application. While the cognitive process may be complimented by the application, charting this distinction helps focus the design process, ensuring support of core application functionality.

This distinction helps to focus both the design process and the testing. See [assembly ](https://communications.xalgorithms.org/rule-maker/table-editor-ui/) to understand how this distinction informs the UI of rule assembly. 

**Continuous Testing**

With staged implementation, it is possible to engage in multiple parallel tracks of user testing. While metadata is being rolled out with stakeholder involvement, it is crucial to continue user testing with contributors. This was initiated with limited success last year in the form of journey mapping the authorship process. However these effort need to be redoubled. Even while development happens on the prototype application, there is opportunity for valuable testing utilizing paper prototypes, and other low cost, low fidelity methods. This method of physical exploration proved valuable, as evidenced by Joseph's stick and stone prototyping method.

 **Modular Assembly**
 
 To facilitate rapid iteration, and the implantation of insights gleaned from user-testing, it is important to have a low cost front end development methodology. The best way to achieve this is through the creation of a simple Rule Maker API. This allows for the simultaneous creation of multiple UIs with a relatively low technical threshold required for development. This reduces the cost of prototyping, iteration, and updates. 
 
The MO adopted by contributors to build new applications rather than augment existing code bases. Building an API makes this process much cheaper, enabling this pattern of development already adopted by developers. 
 

##  Conclusion

Rule Maker presents many challenges. Rule authoring requires a heavy cognitive load. Novel mechanics must be developed and introduced to users. On top of this, many common design technique are not applicable to this project. 

The solution is multiform:

- Implement in Stages
- Focus Supported Actions
- Continuous Testing
- Modular Assembly

Combined, these strategies enable a human centered focus, create solutions that work for developers, and bring value to stakeholders in graduated stages.
