The Xalgorithms Foundation is [Decentralized Collaborative Organization](https://xalgorithms.org/community). It has contributors across continents. Contributors lend their expertise across a variety of project types and disciplines. To facilitate the organization's mission it is critical to establish tools and frameworks that facilitate cross-functional collaboration.

Brand plays a multifaceted role in this effort to improve the tools and frameworks that facilitate decentralized collaborative work. Brand embodies the organization's values, contributing to the creation of a shared sense of community among distributed contributors. At the same time, the Brand must be situated within tactical and strategic objective that enable it to be operationalized, leveraging impact, and facilitating implementation.

#### Defining a Flexible Community Oriented Identity

To define a brand for the Xalgorithms Foundation, it is crucial to understand the significance of a brand within a decentralized context. In a [Headless Brand](https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/) Toby Shorin writes: 

> Brand is one of the strongest assets for decentralized protocols. A headless brand strategy is an ecosystemic affair and entails the mobilization of a decentralized set of actors. At its core, it revolves around giving agency to different stakeholders in a way that lets them coordinate more effectively and feel connected to the brand.

Understood as a constellation of assets which generate orientation at key points in the collaborative journey,  the brand situates contributors within a common context of the organization's intended impact, and emergent outcomes. This is a characteristic of communications across channels. Given the open-source nature of the organization, the collaborative journey spans a person's first encounters on social media, all the way through to engaging with activities within the project management structure.  ^5f6ec4

In this context, the organizations identity is contingent upon the action of the contributors. It is not a set of guidelines imposed from the top down. Rather it is a set of building blocks that people use to organically define the culture of the organization. Operationalizing the brand requires engaging with the sociological reality of the identity—and this calls for defining collateral that is tolerant, expressive, and simple enough to enable use by contributors in ways that supports their emergent goals.   ^a82a79


**Logo Mark**

<RandomLogo />

The logo mark was defined through an iterative process. The mark references the quaternary logic central to the and tabular programming style articulated in the DWDS paper. At the same time, shapes in the mark reference "operational bubbles" which describe the spheres of collective sense-making held across individuals in collaborative environments. Together these symbols speak to the intended outputs of the organization.

To be effective, the logo mark must be operationalized. This means considering not just what the formal definition of the mark, but optimizing for use by contributors. This was accomplished in n ways:

1. creating a mark that was tollerent enough that it could be recreated, modified, and expressed in a variety of mediums. The idea was that a formal lockup was not needed. Rather a simply geometry was defined that could be reproduced.

```jsx
// a constellation among the stars
*                           *         .
    ●  •  ●        *          
    •  ●  .          . 
    ●  .  •                                     . 
.                           *
```

But also making it easy to be deployed across working groups

2. enabling the assets to be accessed as npm packages, as part of the design system. 

``
```cl
$ yarn add xf-material components
```

```jsx
// App.js

import Logo from 'xf-material-components'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
		 <Logo />
    </div>
  );
}
```
