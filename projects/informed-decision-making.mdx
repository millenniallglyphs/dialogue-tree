I was tasked with co-leading the design of the statistics page intended to monitor the health of the Webb network. This was important for developers do assess their designs, but it was also important for earlier users, to help them make decisions about the timing and chain target of their transaction.

One problem was that most  statistic pages we researched in the space were cluttered, with poor information hierarchy. Information was double-stacked in rows, without consideration for what developers and users actually needed to look at. 

It also became clear in our initial discovery that much of the information was sequential, and it was important that developers had the ability to explore network details chronologically.

The solution was to ask the developers what information they needed to see at a glance and to reveal the remaining details through progressive disclosure. A side panel was the most effective way to display this additional information and allowed for the inclusion of previous and next controls, letting developers to flip through the details in chronological order.

In conclusion, the design of the statistics page for monitoring the health of the Webb network addressed crucial issues found in existing statistic pages. By engaging developers to determine the essential information needed at a glance and implementing progressive disclosure, we ensured a user-friendly interface without overwhelming users with unnecessary details. The introduction of a side panel with chronological exploration capabilities further enhanced the user experience. This collaborative and user-centric approach resulted in a functional and purposeful statistics page that will empower both developers to make informed decisions about their use of the Webb network.
