Rule maker is an interface that allows people to write logic rich rules without using code. However, it became clear that people found it challenging to write the structured sentences which are a key part of the rule authoring process. I proposed a new canvas form factor that improved authorship abilities, by tapping into people's natural inclination to creatively puzzle out how a sentence should be formed when given the space and ability to do so.

The breakthrough came when experimenting with paper prototypes. I asked colleagues and friends to use the paper prototype to write a rule. By observing this process, I saw how people moved the pieces of the structured sentence around on their desk, trying out a word, and fitting them into place in the sequence.

It was clear a new form factor was needed. The fill in the blank approach we had implemented did not fit how people actually went about forming structured sentences. People needed a flexible way to explore, reorder, puzzle out the right words. I realized that the effective table top experience could be replicated by using a spatial canvas to craft rules.

This process revealed the challenges users faced with the Rule Maker interface in structuring sentences. Through experimentation with paper prototypes, it became evident that a new form factor was required to facilitate the natural process of creative sentence formation. The introduction of a spatial canvas allowed users to explore, reorder, and puzzle out the right words, replicating the effective table top experience and significantly improving the authorship abilities within Rule Maker.
