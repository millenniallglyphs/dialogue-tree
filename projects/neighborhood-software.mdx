### Exposition

Web3 enables novel funding mechanisms, and methods of interrelating that enable software to be developed in contexts and at scales not previously viable. Platform cooperatives and decentralized collaborative organizations have the opportunity to create bespoke software solutions for their specific community contexts. While these groups may not be in physical proximity, the metaphor of the neighborhood provides a mental model for understanding the shared culture, familiar attitude, and common directionality that characterizes these groups. 

### Problem

![basket of trunnels](/trunnel.jpg)

Designing neighborhood scale software ask: how do people collaborate in this context? What tools, and design patterns are most useful? What kinds of outcomes can be expected?

This inquiry began as a personal research project, exploring diverse sources. Information from management studies, economics, product development, and commons management all proved useful. I took particular inspiration from Christopher Alexander's idea of a Pattern Language.

At the same time as I was exploring these lines of inquiry, I began a conversation with x at hyperlink academy. This lead to this ideas being fleshed out into the following syllabus:

#### 🔮 Week One | Introduction 

🧠 Activities Meet and greet Prisoner's dilemma Introduce the course project 

📖 [Readings](https://www.are.na/calvin-hutcheon/i-nb0yglsiygg): Kaplinsky: "The Economies of Small" chapt 2. | Alexander: "The Timeless Way of Building" chapt 14. ✏️ Building off the readings, document two patterns from your life where technology gives life. 

#### 🏡 Week Two | Methodology and patterns 

🧠 Discussion: what makes a pattern? What makes technology appropriate? What are life giving patterns in life? Where do they intersect with technology?

📖 [Readings](https://www.are.na/calvin-hutcheon/ii-9fiv-9584n4): Hayek: "The Use of Knowledge in Society" | Oliva "The Road to Servomechanisms" |  Ostrom "Governing the Commons" chapt 1. ✏️ Homework: collect patterns related to users interacting with technology.

 #### 👽 Week Three | What is a user? 
 
 🧠 Activities Discussion: what kinds of language is used in UX? How does this describe the user? How does this intersect with the readings? Discussion: who are your users? Are they users or something else? 
 
 📖 [Readings](https://www.are.na/calvin-hutcheon/iii-b7h4bvy4uvy):  Zhang et al. "Policy Kit" | Benet "What Exactly is Web3?" ✏️ Homework find one example of a project that uses, or approaches appropriate use of technology. Determine what patter/patterns it uses. 

#### 🔗  Week Four | Web3 and then some 

🧠 Activities Discussion: how are Ostrom's ideas brought into the digital space? How do the examples approach the use of technology? What about these patterns works?  

📖 [Readings](https://www.are.na/calvin-hutcheon/iv-wxbq1d5i4es) Graham & Thrift: "Out of Order" | Mattern "Maintenance and Care" ✏️ Homework identify a problem you're interested in solving. Attempt to put together some patterns that address this problem.

#### 🦎 Week Five | Maintenance 

🧠 Activities Discussion: How does maintenance play a role? Do you encounter issues with maintenance in digital spaces? How can maintenance, overtime, create something that is more whole and alive? What is the least powerful approach needed to realize this idea? 

📖 [Reading](https://www.are.na/calvin-hutcheon/v-ivmlk6kpzfq) Hill "Grid, Non-Grid" | PRFAQ ✏️ Homework Craft a PRFAQ for your idea

#### 🎁 Week Six | Show and Tell 

🧠 Activities: Share our ideas Next steps? Feedback Celebration

### Rising Action

For six weeks I facilitated a class of 8 as we explored this material. Each session was an interactive discussion held via video chat, combined with slides and activities in figma. 

Discussing the readings, sharing experiences, and exploring existing tools and software, we began framing our own ideas for an application of neighborhood scale software design. These specific examples informed further thinking and the identification of specific design patterns.

### Climax

The result of the class was a collection of some of the patterns identified throughout the span of the course. I put together a basic website that could serve as an archive for people to explore. However, contributing patterns required the use of pull requests, which made participation lower than expected. Despite this short coming, a vibrant collection of patterns was compiled. You can explore the library here.

### Falling Action

While the course has concluded, this line of inquiry continues. I am in the process of using the format of the course as a framework to write a series of essays exploring the performance of decentralized collaborative organizations. With further research, and upon the publication of this writing, I hope to facilitate another cohort of this course.
