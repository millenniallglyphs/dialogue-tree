### problem trying to solve

Thinking about how to bridge the gap between technical thinking and community needs.

Inspired by fractal localism, wanted to think about what it would look like to build and deploy products for specific, embedded community needs—particularly rural settings. 

A different model for how tech is built—generated in the same way a small market

### describe the approach

thought about structuring it as a board game

looking at a mix of theory 
x, y, z

made use of x paper in how to organize lessons


### results

 a six week course 
 
 8 class members
 $1200 in course fees

### impact of the work

difficult to measure—would like to run again

helped me discover and connect with platform cooperatives, etc.
