Create a best in class bridging experience, with built in privacy controls was the task I faced co-leading the design for Webb's cross-chain, zero-knowledge bridge. With a clear mission, the main challenge was translating complex transactions into an intuitive, trustworthy and transparent interface, while balancing the significant technical constraints of this emergent protocol.

The initial prototype required a two step process, where the user copied a secret key needed to complete a withdrawal. We realized that the best user experience would be a single step bridging experience, automating away the need for a separate withdrawal action, by empowering the user with time and security based controls. Our goal was to provide metrics surfacing the changing security profile of each bridge (based on the liquidity of each side, and the number of subsequent transactions) without having to include complex network statistics.

However due to technical constraints, we could not fully automate the process in the initial implementation.  So we came up with a roadmap to achieve a best in class user experience:
1. launching with a basic bridge that required manual withdrawal
2. developing a statistics page to surface network help
3. bring relevant statistics into the bridge app 
4. use that to develop security metrics and implement automated single step cross chain transactions

Designing for trust and transparency required careful creative solutions and compromise. While only steps one and two have been achieved, we have implemented designs that enable users to manage their assets in an informed manner. As the roadmap is completed, Both the ease of use, and the level of trust and transparency will continue to improve.
