To achieve the emergent outcomes that define the Xalgorithms Foundation core working groups, key outputs are defined. Three of these outputs are applications. Additionally, websites are needed for the communication purposes of working groups. In order to establish a cohesive identity across these multiple channels, it was clear a design system was needed to consolidate the components that form the UI of applications and websites.

Creating a design system was intended to ensure best user experience across applications and websites, streamline the design process, and facilitates front end development tasks. Meeting the needs of users, designers and developers was crucial to the success of this project. Thus forming the constraints etc.... 

**Ensuring Best User Experience**

To ensure the best user experience across applications it was important to consider issues of accessibility, multi-lingual functionality, and brand conformance. This draws directly from the intended impact:

> Increased capacity to draft, publish, access, audit, and operationalize normative rules by people (and machines) 

From this its clear that not only must the interfaces make rules accessible to non-technical people, it is also critical that rules are accessible to people regardless of ability, or language preference. This influenced  a number of key decisions.

All components in the library use Fira Sans (and Fira Code). Fira has high legibility, and has gone significant user testing by the Mozilla foundation to ensure readability on screens. Importantly, Fira is an open source project with an active group of contributors maintaining glyphs across alphabets. This means that Fira has exceptional multi-lingual support, that includes Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari and more.

When making color choices, it was important to ensure that color could be used to direct user actions, support the brand identity, while at the same time supporting users regardless of vision status. This meant considering issues of contrast and conducting usability testing across the color library.

Finally making the best possible user experience requires correct dev implementation. For this reason, special attention to  documentation was required to ensure compliance with accessibility standards, such as including image alts. 

**Streamlining Design Process**

Creating a dedicated design system streamlines the design process. In Figma projects it is a simple process to import the library to begin building a high fidelity flow once the wire-frame stage is completed. This ensure consistency when collaborating with other designers. Also, given the fact that this is an open source porject. This ensure easy on-boarding for designers that contribute to the project.

**Facilitating Dev Work**

The final goal was to facilitate development, streamline prototyping, and create a shared sense of dev objective through a cohesive brand framework. Since the Xalgorithms Foundation website and the Rule Maker prototype are built in react, the natural choice was to create a react component library. I built a minimal component library containing all the atomic components of the design system. This is deployed as an NPM package for ease of deployment. 

```cl
$ yarn add xf-material-components
```

```jsx
// App.js

    import Logo from 'xf-material-components'

    function App() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <Logo />
            </div>
        );
    }
```

However, it was important to maximize flexibility. To help ensure effective design even with developers not working in a react framework, I but together a bassic css file containing color, font, etc to provide a starting point. 

```html
// index.html
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet"
          type="css"
          href="xf-material-components/config/rootStyle.css">
    </head>
```

Similarly, I built a simple hugo template to facilitate documentation. This is also how I documented all of the elements of the design system. Test out the theme by starting a new [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) project.

```cl
$ hugo new site quickstart
```

Next, add the template as a submodule.

```cl
$ cd quickstart
    $ git init
    $ git submodule add https://gitlab.com/seeddisburser/xf-material-theme.git
```

Include the theme in the config.

```cl
$ echo 'theme = "xf-material-theme"' >> config.toml
```
